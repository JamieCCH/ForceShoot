# ForceShoot
Physics Engine Lab 1 &amp; 2

This lab will count as 10% as it is two labs being combines into one.

Objective:

This is a two player game.  The game consists of up to 5 rounds.  Each round gives the players three turns.  Each turn the player is giving an opportunity to slide their object towards the destination.  You have to calculate the correct force to be applied to get the object to the destination.  Using whatever game design you like to allow the player to aim and guess at the correct force, you will gauge if the player over/under shoots or gets it spot on.  At the end of the round the player closest to the destination gets a point.  Each turn is worth only one point. First player to three wins the game.

Friction, and weight of the objects can be whatever you like.

Make it clear what the score is, and who the winner is when the game is over.
